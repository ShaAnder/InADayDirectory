### IN A DAY

#### SUMMARY

In a day is a project / challenge i started to showcase my ever growing skillsets in the languages I am proficient or enjoy doing. This isn't quite a portfolio piece but it can in some aspects be considered one. The Point of in a day is that every project showcased here was built to be as complete as possible... In a day. As well as this the projects can be anything, simple apps, games, or just code snippets.

I will theorycraft, design and build as much of a project as I can in a day, while the project itself will not be complete i will always aim to build a readme that details what was done, how it works and what's still left to finish. (these will likely come a few days after initial project is done with, as im not counting the readme as part of the project timeline)

On a final note i will not be building a project every day as im currently a uni student and looking for full time work too, this is just projects built in one day.

#### RULES

So in short the self imposed rules I set for this directory are as follows:

1. I will conceptualize, design and implement the project to the best of my ability in a total of 1 day
2. This means 24 hours total, from initial repo creation to end of building

- This means some projects will see updates across multiple dates

3. After completion of the 24 hours the project will NEVER be updated, although i may in the future build out full fleshed apps from the ideas contained within
4. I will update the projects with a readme at later points, these readmes will serve as a means / insight into how i designed and executed the creation
5. Any sources / inspiration / guides used to further completeion will be detailed and credited
